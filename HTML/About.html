			<p class="pesquisa">Breast cancer is the most common in women in the world, with approximately 2.3 million new cases estimated in 2020, representing 24.5% of new cases of cancer in women.</p><br><br>
			<p class="tituloPesquisa">Does have breast cancer in men?</p><br>

			<br>
			<p class="tituloPesquisa">What is the percentage of breast cancer in men?</p><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Breast cancer affects 1% of the male population and is more prevalent in obese and etilist men. Men should be alerted and informed about breast cancer as well. Compared to women, breast cancer is rarer, with an incidence of approximately 1% in the male population in general.<br><br>	
			More than 17,500 women and almost 200 men die of breast cancer in Brazil each year. At least 48 people die daily from this tumor.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="tituloPesquisa">Cure</p><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Breast cancer is an uncontrolled growth of cells (cells of the lobes, milk-producing cells, or ducts, through which milk is drained), which acquire abnormal characteristics, caused by one or more mutations in their genetic material.</p><br><br>
			
			<img src="../Imagens/cura.jpg" class="imgCura" title="https://www.accamargo.org.br/sobre-o-cancer/tipos-de-cancer/mama"><br>
	
			<p class="pesquisa">When mutations occur in the genetic material of one or more cells, they can acquire the ability not only to divide uncontrolled, but also to prevent cell death that would be normal in the life cycle of any cell in the body, and also to invade nearby tissues. It's these cells that give rise to cancer.</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Breast cancer can be cured. The sooner it is detected, the easier it will be to cure it. If at diagnosis the tumor is less than 1 centimeter (initial stage), the chances of cure reach 95%.</p><br><br>
			
			<p class="tituloPesquisa">Prevention:</p><br><br>
			<p class="tituloPesquisaA">1. Practice physical activity</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Balances hormone levels, improves the body's defense and helps in maintaining proper weight, factors that directly influence breast cancer prevention.</p><br><br>

			<p class="tituloPesquisaA">2. Eating healthy and maintaining proper body weight</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Excess weight generates hormonal changes that can cause mutations in cells or growth of already altered cells. Therefore, maintaining the proper weight is critical to prevent this from happening.</p><br><br>

			<p class="tituloPesquisaA">3. Avoid the consumption of alcoholic beverages</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Alcohol can help in the onset of cancer by different mechanisms (damages DNA, makes human tissues more sensitive to damage, among others). Avoiding the ingestion of all types of alcoholic beverages favors the prevention not only of breast cancer, but of countless others.</p><br><br>

			<p class="tituloPesquisaA">4. Do not smoke and avoid passive smoking</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">Cigarettes and other smoke producers (hookah, cigar, cigarillo, among others) contain at least 69 chemicals that cause cancer. Avoiding smoking or being around people who smoke are important measures that can contribute to prevention.</p><br><br>

			<p class="tituloPesquisaA">5. Breastfeeding</p><br><br>
			<p class="pesquisa">During the lactation period, the rates of some hormones that favor the development of this type of cancer fall in women. In addition, in breastfeeding there is also renewal of cells that could have lesions, thus decreasing the chances of the disease. The longer breastfeeding is, the greater the protection for the mother.</p><br><br>
